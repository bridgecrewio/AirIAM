#### AirIAM is a tool that helps manage AWS IAM and migrate it to IaC.

## Introduction
AirIAM scans existing IAM usage patterns and provides a simple method to migrate IAM configurations into a rightsized 
Terraform plan. It identifies unused users, roles, groups, policies and policy attachments and replaces them with a 
Least Privileges terraform code modeled accordingly.

By moving all configurations into Terraform code, users can start tracking, auditing and modifying IAM configurations 
as part of their standard infrastructure-as-code provisioning processes.

AirIAM is battle-tested and is recommended for use in Dev, QA and test environments that have been previously managed 
by humans. It is design to result in minimal affect on existing workloads. If you are interested in migrating a Prod 
account, contact us at info@bridgecrew.io or [open a ticket](https://bridgecrew.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## Features

- Detects unused IAM resources using native AWS and [Amazon Access Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/identify-unused-iam-roles-remove-confidently-last-used-timestamp/) APIs.
- Provide scripts to remove unused entities en-masse
- Effortless migration of existing IAM configurations into a simple Least Privileges IaC model. 
- Integrates with [Checkov](https://checkov.io) to track unwanted configuration changes and configuration drift.


## Commands
- `find_unused` - Uses AWS IAM APIs to detect unused users, roles, groups, policies and policy attachments. Also,
it adds links to scripts and automation which will help remove these entities in a quick and easy way. [Learn more 
about these scripts and automation](RecommendedIntegrations.md).
- `recommend_groups` - Uses AWS IAM APIs to identify the different level of usages and create groups according to these
levels. Currently supported groups:
    - Admins - users which have the AdministratorAccess policy attached, will be added to the admins group which will 
    have the policy `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess` attached
    - PowerUsers - users which have write access to **any** of the services they use will be added to the powerusers 
    group(s). In case of more than 10 policies being attached to that group, a number of groups will be created for 
    powerusers, and the relevant users will be members of all of them.
    - ReadOnly - users which only have read access to the account. Will be members of the readonly group which will have 
    the policy `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess` attached 
- `terraform` - Creates Terraform files based on the configurations and the transformations applied by the optional
arguments supplied

### Flow
The three commands above are run after the other, in sync, as can be seen in the diagram below.

When executed, AirIAM starts by scanning the AWS account using the specified profile. 
If `find_unused` was the command specified, the results are outputted and the execution completes.
If `recommend_groups` was the command specified, after the stage of group recommendation the results are outputted and 
the execution completes.
Otherwise, the `terraform` command has been specified - and so it takes the results and creates the relevant
terraform code and state file to manage the IAM from there.

## Getting started

### Installation

```sh
pip install airiam 
```

### Run Configurations

#### General configurations for all commands
- `profile / p` defines which profile to use for AWS access. If none specified, the AWS credentials will be taken from 
the default places (environment variables, default profile etc.)
- `last-unused-threshold / l` defines the threshold, in days, for entities to be marked as unused. Default value is 90
- `no-cache` defines whether to reuse local data or re-scan. If this is the first time or the account was changed from
the last run, cache invalidation will occur anyway.

#### `find_unused`
- `output / o` defines the output format of the command. Default value is CLI.

#### `recommend_groups`
- `output / o` defines the output format of the command. Default value is CLI.

#### `terraform`
- `directory / d` defines the output directory for the terraform code. Default value is `results/`
- `ignore / i` defines a path to a text file listing regexp of entities which will be ignored by the terraform code 
generator. 
- `--without-unused` defines unused should not be moved to terraform.

### Running the commands

```sh
airiam find_unused --profile dev --last-used-threshold 30 --no-cache

airiam recommend_groups --profile dev --last-used-threshold 90 --no-cache -o json

airiam terraform --profile dev --last-used-threshold 90 --no-cache --directory tf/iam -i ignore.txt --without-unused
```

## Alternatives

### Other AWS IAM Cleanup Tools 
For AWS IAM usage scanners check out [CloudTracker](https://github.com/duo-labs/cloudtracker), 
[Trailscraper](https://github.com/flosell/trailscraper/), 
[Aadvark](https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/aardvark) & [Repokid](https://github.com/Netflix/repokid).
The main difference between these tools and AirIAM is that these tools identify unused permissions but do not help
in AWS IAM management and provide mediocre visibility. AirIAM also moves the problem into static terraform code, which
allows an entire set of code analysis tools to manage and identify deviations and changes.

### Other AWS IAM Policy MaC (management-as-code) Tools
For static IAM policy linting, check out [Parliament](https://github.com/duo-labs/parliament).
Parliament is actually integrated into AirIAM, and is run on the policies it gets from your AWS account. 

For automatically creating IAM policies and managing them as code, check out  [aws-iam-generator](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-iam-generator),
[PolicySentry](https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry).
These tools help create better policies, but do not help with existing AWS IAM setup.

### Other Migration of AWS to terraform Tools
For other tools that help migrate existing AWS IAM setup to terraform, check out 
[terracognita](https://github.com/cycloidio/terracognita/) and [terraforming](https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming).
AirIAM is the only tool which supports migrating all relevant IAM entities to terraform v0.12.

## Contributing

Contribution is welcomed!

We would love to hear about other IAM governance models for additional use cases as well as new ways to identify over-permissive IAM resources. 

## Support

[Bridgecrew](https://bridgecrew.io) builds and maintains AirIAM to encourage the adoption of IAM-as-code and enforcement of IAM Rightsizing and Least Privileges best practices in policy-as-code. 

Start with our [Documentation](https://bridgecrewio.github.io/airiam/) for quick tutorials and examples.
